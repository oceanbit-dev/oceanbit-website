With this release you can clone repos, make changes to files, make a commit right from your phone or tablet and push them back to your repos!



We're not ones to rest on our laurels, however. As this blog post is being launched, our designers are working on revamping our design system to be more prepared for new features and design improvements and our developers are working on adding the Git branching feature we're hoping to include with the next release.
